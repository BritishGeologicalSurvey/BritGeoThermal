			<h2>Eastgate, Weardale, County Durham</h2>
			<p>The Eastgate well was drilled to 995&nbsp;m in 2004. It was the first deep geothermal exploration borehole to be drilled in the UK for over 20 years. <br />

                <h2><span class="blue">The Cheshire Basin</span> </h2>
                <p>The Permo-Triassic deposits within the Cheshire basin at depths of between 1 and 4&nbsp;km  have been assessed as a potential low enthalpy geothermal resource that could provide a future supply of low carbon energy to the west Cheshire area.<br />

          <h2>Min ewaters beneath Glasgow</h2>
                <p>BGS, in conjunction with Glasgow City Council, has been investigating the thermal potential of abandoned flooded min eworkings as a potential source of heating and cooling for buildings in Glasgow.<br /><a href="glasgowmw.html">More&raquo;&raquo;</a>
			<h2><span class="blue">Science Central - Newcastle upon Tyne</span></h2>
			<p>The Science Central Well was drilled in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne to a depth of 1821&nbsp;m in 2011. This research well awaits further testing but could serve the new developments at the Science Central site. <br />

                <h2><span class="blue">The East Midlands Basin </span></h2>
                <p>The East Midlands oil province has potential as a future source of geothermal energy. This could help to extend field life and offer the oil industry opportunities for diversification using existing infrastructure. This study considers the Welton Field as a potential future resource.<br />

                <h2><span class="red">Characterisation of the Southern Negros Geothermal Field, Philippines </span></h2>
                <p>The Energy Development Corporation (EDC) currently owns five operational geothermal projects throughout the Philippines and has drilled many of geothermal wells over the past 30 years. However, the company has faced several challenges related to fault structures in the region.<br />
