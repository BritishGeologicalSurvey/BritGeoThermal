<h3>Geothermal Potential of Ladakh Granite, Jammu and Kashmir State</h3>					
<p>The ‘Geothermal Atlas of India’ describes some 340 hot spring sites and identifies more than 300 sites with geothermal energy potential in at least seven key geothermal provinces throughout India.  About half of these sites are located in the Himalayan region, mainly in the northwestern sector where post-Tertiary granite intrusions are considered to be responsible for the high thermal gradients (>100°C/km) and heat flows (>468 mW/m2). There are more than 20 hot spring sites in Jammu & Kashmir State, of which, 12 are in the Chenab Valley in the Lesser/Central Himalaya, at least 4 are in the Kashmir Valley and 6 are in the High Himalaya region of Ladakh.</p>
<p>The hot springs in Jammu & Kashmir State form part of the Northwest Himalayan Geothermal Province which extends along the Himalaya mountain belt both to the southeast into the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and on through Nepal and Tibet and to the northwest into the Punch, Gilgit, Hunza and Yasin valleys in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and the Northwest Province of Pakistan.  All the main hot spring sites are concentrated along major tectonic features formed during the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. Geothermal resources within the Himalayan Geothermal Province have already been developed in Tibet.  A binary 5 kW pilot geothermal power plant was also commissioned at Manikaran in the Kulu District of Himachal Pradesh in the 1990’s.</p>
<p>The power requirement in Ladakh today is around 100 MW and is increasing annually. Present total civil generation is about 13.5 MW. Domestic diesel generation (including hotels) may be another 3 to 5 MW. In addition, the army generates around 15 MW. Two hydro projects, at Chutak and Nimoo-Bazgo of 46 MW each are planned. However variability of hydro power output during winter means that some diesel power generation may be required as back-up.</p>
<p>It is estimated that geothermal resources at Puga could generate 20 MW with additional generation from Chumathang and Panamik. Geothermal is viewed as the only option for power generation for the Leh district if the use of diesel is to be avoided. This would improve the lives of local people and army and para-military personnel posted to the area. A demonstration plant producing between 2-5MW has been proposed to prove the potential.</p>
