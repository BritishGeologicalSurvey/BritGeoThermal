			<h2>Mon 13<sup>th</sup> October 2014, The Geological Society, London 10:00-20:00</h2>
            <h1><span class="blue">The Fourth London Geothermal Symposium: The Launch of Brit</span><span class="red">Geothermal</span><span class="blue"> </span></h1>
			
			
			<p>Momentum in the geothermal industry is growing as demonstrated by the recent announcement of several new UK geothermal projects. This one day symposium provides an opportunity to listen to presentations from - and network with – the UK policy makers, academic and corporate players involved in this nascent renewables sector.</p>
			
            <h2>Who Should Attend?</h2>
			<p>Anyone from commerce, government or academia currently interested in developing or researching low enthalphy geothermal systems and also anyone interested in investigating the deep geothermal potential of sites within their management or ownership in more detail.</p>
            <p>The event will provide a snapshot of current deep geothermal development in the UK by delivering sessions on geothermal heat only and power generation schemes and will introduce the recently established BritGeothermal research partnership. Invited speakers include representatives from industry, government and academia. There will also be time for networking during the lunch and post conference drinks reception.</p>
            <h2>Draft Programme</h2>
            <p>Please note timings and session order may change with speaker availability</p>

			</div>
			<h2>September 2014, Newcastle upon Tyne</h2>
			<h2>Scope of the conference</h2>
			<p>The conference programme will focus upon the exploitation of low enthalpy deep geothermal resources in the UK and beyond and is anticipated to include updates on current deep geothermal energy research, with case studies from existing and planned deep geothermal projects.</p>
			<p>There will be an opportunity to deliver or listen to presentations, browse poster presentations during refreshment breaks and meet other people interested in researching or exploiting deep geothermal systems. This page will be updated as the conference programme develops.</p>
			<p>The conference will be held at </p>
