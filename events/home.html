      <h2>CANCELLED Thursday 15<sup>th</sup> October 2015, The Geological Society, London 13:30-20:00</h2>
      <h1><span class="blue">The Fifth London Geothermal Symposium: Securing our Geothermal Future</span> (Cancelled)</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately due to lack of sponsorship and registrations, BritGeothermal and EGS Energy have made the difficult decision to cancel the symposuim this year as it will not be possible to cover the costs of running this event. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and would like to thank those of you who had registered (registration fees will be refunded) and also to the people and organisations that had agreed to speak.</p>
 
<p>We would very much like to hold the event next year and hope that you would consider joining us then, by which time we hope to have more interest from both sponsors and participants. 
</p>
     
      <h2>Presentations from the Fourth Symposium, held 13<sup>th</sup> Oct 2014</h2>
