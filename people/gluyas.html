			<h3> Biography </h3>
			<p>Jon is head of the Department of Earth Sciences at Durham University and holds the Dong/Ikon Chair in Geoenergy Carbon Capture and Storage. With career experiences in both industry and academia, he worked for 28 years within the oil industry. From 2001 to 2009 Jon co-founded two oil companies, the latter one with $300 million of initial equity. His technical background relates to the redevelopment of old or abandoned fields, which combines both geosciences and reservoir engineering. From 1999 Jon held an honorary chair in petroleum geoscience at Durham University and from 2009 took up a full time post as Professor in Geoenergy and Carbon Capture and Storage. This has included working for the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change to evaluate bids for the UK's national CCS Demonstration Programme as well leadership of the UK's CCS Research Centre Development Board. Jon now researches carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy and petroleum geosciences while maintaining strong links with industry. Recent work in the field of geothermal energy includes being involved in the drilling of the three most recently drilled deep geothermal wells in the UK. </p>
