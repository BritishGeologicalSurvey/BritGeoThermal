			<h3>Biography</h3>
			<p>Paul accepted the role of professor of energy engineering at Glasgow University in August 2012 and holds the Rankine Chair of Engineering. His research interests range from water resources and environmental engineering (especially groundwater engineering), on through mining environmental engineering to energy engineering. His industrial experience includes Yorkshire Water, the National Rivers Authority, Centro Yunta (La Paz, Bolivia), NIREX, Northumbrian Water, Project Dewatering Ltd, Cluff Geothermal Ltd, Five-Quarter Energy Ltd and various consultancy missions worldwide. Previously Paul spent just under 20 years at Newcastle University, where, amongst other things, he founded and led the HERO research group, which went on to win the University the Queen's Anniversary Prize for the first time (2005). He established what is now the Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research, founded and Directed the Newcastle Institute for Research on Sustainability (NIReS) and served as the University's Public Orator and its first-ever Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Engagement. Paul recently led the drilling and testing of the only three deep geothermal exploration boreholes to be drilled in the UK since the 1980s. </p>
